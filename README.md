# Movie-Rental-System-in-Python
This was my first assignment of college using Python. The task was to create a movie rental system. User can select a movie from a list and rent it. A bill would be generated in the name of user. If user could not return movie within given time, he/she would be charged with certain amount of fine. 

Features of this system:
This project consists of lots of features that are very useful for the users of the program. This Movie Rental System comprises lots of features like storing the transaction data, checking movieâ€™s stock, updating the stocks after each and every transactions, generating the bills, calculating the total amount of the movie rented by the customer, generating the bills with fine if there is any and so on. One of the main features of this project is that it makes the job of recording data more efficiently so that the data can be reliable. It also helps to reduce the time consumption. The risk of losing the data is minimal and moreover the items are also less prone to lose as the records of each movie are kept. It also helps the user to see all the quantity of movie very easily by just click a button. It is way more convenient than checking the records in paper. It is a simple program so no one needs any special knowledge to use it. So, these are some features of this project.
